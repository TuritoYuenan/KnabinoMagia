**Magical girls** are the main type of characters in the fiction. They are teenage girls from 13 to 20 years old who are given magical powers. Most Magical girls in this fiction are National Magical girls, which means they represents their countries in significant ways.

A Magical girl can be categorised by several factors:
## Nationality
Obviously, a Magical girl's nationality is the country that Magical girl currently lives in as a citizen
## Department
Department often means where does a Magical girl work or what is their subject. The three main departments is
- Cultural: Preserve, protect and promote their country's cultural heritages.
- Political: Involves in national security, warfare or governmental activities of their country.
- Civil: Protect a certain region in their country, or work in other fields such as science or first responders.
## Profession (optional)
Many Magical girls have their own skills and non-magical abilities that can either be used alongside or enhanced by their magical abilities. For example:
- Claire is a Magical girl who works as a **journalist** and she can fly using her magic - which helps making it easier to record.
## Energy source
Magical girls gather their magical power from a specified source of their own choice. There are many sources of energy, but are generally grouped to two kinds
- An entity (**External**) such as the Sun (Solar) or the Moon (Lunar).
- An energy unit (**Internal**) like a Soul gem (Soul energy).
