# Knabino Magia's Worldbuilding repository

Knabino Magia is a Magical girl fiction by me (Turito Yuenan) that tells the stories of magical girls from different places and culture around the planet

This is the Worldbuilding repo, containing worldbuilding data for the fiction that can then be compiled to a [Hugo website](https://turitoyuenan.github.io/knabino-magia)

The contents can hopefully be accessed [here](content) in Markdown format
